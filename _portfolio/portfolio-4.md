# FinJect: Object Detection and Tagging System

## Introduction
FinJect is an innovative application designed to empower visually impaired users by enabling them to find objects in an enclosed space through voice commands. Utilizing advanced IoT and AI technologies, FinJect combines object tagging with BLE tags and object/image detection methods to create a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Patent Information
This application is protected under Indian Patent Law with the application number: 202021054835. The patent encompasses a novel method and system for automatic object finding within an enclosed space, leveraging both speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversions, alongside advanced image processing techniques. For more detailed information on the patent, please visit the [Indian Patent Office's Public Search Portal](https://iprsearch.ipindia.gov.in/publicsearch).


## Key Features
- **Voice Command Activation:** Users can locate objects by simply speaking the name of the object, making the application intuitive and accessible.
- **Dual Technology Integration:** Incorporates both Object Tagging Method (IoT) using BLE tags for frequently used items and Object Detection Method (AI) for a comprehensive range of object detection.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with the visually impaired in mind, offering a simple and effective user interface that relies on voice recognition and speech feedback.
- **Cost-Effective Solution:** Unlike other applications that focus on either image processing or tag-based location, FinJect effectively uses both technologies to provide a cost-effective solution.

## System Requirements
- Android Smartphone with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support.
- Compatible BLE tags for object tagging.
- Internet connection for initial setup and periodic updates.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Initial Setup:** Install the FinJect app on your Android device and follow the in-app instructions for setting up BLE tags and object recognition.
2. **Tagging Objects:** Attach BLE tags to frequently used objects and name them through the app using voice commands.
3. **Finding Objects:** Activate the app using a voice command and speak the name of the object you wish to find. The app will guide you to the object using voice feedback.
